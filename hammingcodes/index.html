    <p>Hamming codes are well-understood in binary, but here I describe how they generalize to arbitrary fields. (This was apparently first described by Golay in passing in his short article on Golay codes, but I find his description there quite difficult to read.)</p>
<p>Let $$V$$ be some vector space over some field. Let $$W$$ be the coproduct of all the one-dimensional subspaces of $$V$$. The inclusion of each of these subspaces into $$V$$ gives a linear map from $$W$$ into $$V$$. We take the kernel of this map to be the "codewords" among the vectors of $$W$$.</p>
<p>In other, er, words:</p>
<p>Define an equivalence relation on the nonzero elements of $$V$$, under which two vectors are equivalent just in case they are each scalar multiples of the other. Let us say a "word" is a finite set of nonzero vectors of $$V$$, no two of which are equivalent. In other, er, words, a "word" is a choice function which assigns to each line through the origin of $$V$$ some vector on that line, and which furthermore has finite support (only finitely many lines are assigned nonzero values).</p>
<p>When $$V$$ is finite-dimensional over a finite field, these words can be thought of as strings of a particular finite length (the number of equivalence classes of nonzero vectors) over an alphabet of a particular finite size (the number of vectors on a line; i.e., the size of the field).</p>
<p>The finite support condition ensures that the sum of a word is a well-defined vector. We will say a word is a "codeword" if this sums to zero.</p>
<p>The Hamming distance between two words is the number of lines on which they make different choices.</p>
<p>Our observation is that for every word, there is a unique codeword at Hamming distance ≤ 1 from it. In other words, our choice of codewords makes a perfect single-error correcting code.</p>
<p>This is like so: Given any word, look at its sum. If this is zero, this is already a codeword (and changing any single of its "letters" will change its sum to no longer zero, thus no longer a codeword). If this is nonzero, then we must subtract this nonzero value from the sum to get to a codeword. Well, there is a unique line on which this nonzero value lives, and so that tells us precisely which "letter" we must change and by how much.</p>
<hr />
<p>This gives us a method of constructing perfect single error correcting codes over an alphabet of size $$q = \abs{V}$$, using encoded messages of length $$\ell = \frac{q^n - 1}{q - 1} = 1 + q + q^2 + \ldots + q^{n - 1}$$, for any prime power $$q &gt; 1$$ and choice of $$n$$.</p>
<p>(Note that such message lengths are the only possibilities available for a perfect single error correcting code over an alphabet of prime power size, as we need $$1 + \ell (q - 1)$$ to divide some power of $$q$$. The prime power condition on $$q$$ then forces $$1 + \ell (q - 1)$$ to itself be a power of $$q$$, from which we get $$\ell = \frac{q^n - 1}{q - 1}$$.)</p>
<p>No instance is known of a perfect single error correcting code over different parameters (i.e., over an alphabet whose size is not a prime power), though no proof is known that this is impossible, either (as I understand it).</p>
<p>The above describes a "linear" scheme for constructing perfect single error correcting codes. Note that there also exist non-linear codes with the same alphabet size and message length parameters in some instances (TODO: describe an example). There seems some ambiguity in whether such non-linear codes with these parameters are also called "Hamming codes".</p>
<hr />
<p>Does the above extend to anything interesting over the "field with one element"? The appearance of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-analog">q-analog</a> $$\ell = [n]_q$$ is suggestive, but I'm not sure what to say along these lines.</p>
<hr />
<p>The extended binary Hamming code, with an additional parity bit, can be thought of like so: Words are finite subsets of vector space $$V$$ over $$GF(2)$$ (including allowing the subset to contain 0), and codewords are words containing an even number of vectors summing to 0. These codewords are closed under symmetric difference, and for any odd size word, there is a unique codeword at distance 1 from it, obtained by simply summing up the odd size word and then toggling its value at that sum.</p>
<p>Note that this has a 3-transitive automorphism group, since the codewords are preserved by any affine transformation. (Affine transformations are 3-transitive over GF(2) (where 3 distinct points cannot be collinear) and 2-transitive over other fields.)</p>
