You've come to the right place to see how Sridhar thinks about math. Eventually, I'll figure out how to do stuff like post tagging and searching and so on in a reasonable way, if that can be done on GitHub Pages at all. I'll make properly organized collections of posts and a navigation page and everything. For now, everything is just a scroll of posts. Indeed, for now, I've barely copied over my old posts from [my old wordpress blog](https://howsridharthinks.wordpress.com). But I will.
