You've come to the right place to see how Sridhar thinks about math.

I'll make properly organized collections of posts and a navigation page and everything. For now, everything is just a scroll of posts.

Nothing here is polished, it’s full of TODOs, you shouldn’t be reading this site, who told you it even exists?
