    <p>Consider the free theory with an internal X extending x. When we externalize its internal X, we get some X extending x. But is it x on the dot, or might it be changed from x to have more in it? It seems obvious but not obviously obvious that, when Set itself is an X, we should get back x on the dot. Here, I want to write out the reasoning, to make it obviously obvoius.</p>
<p>I'm phrasing this very abstractly, because I mean for it to apply very broadly. Whatever Xes are, they should form a category. And whatever theories with an internal X are, they should form a category. From the latter to the former, we should have a functor G which sends any theory with an internal X to the externalization of its designated internal X. To say that we have, for any given x : X, a free theory with internal X extending x, is to say that this functor we just noted has a left adjoint F. And to ask for the externalization of this free structure's internal X to be x again, in the desired way, is to ask for the unit of this adjunction to be an isomorphism.</p>
<p>By abstract nonsense, the unit of an adjunction is an isomorphism just in case its left adjoint is fully faithful (because the condition for y to be isomorphic to GFy via the unit is by Yoneda the same as the condition that maps from x to y are in isomorphism with maps from x to GFy via the unit, which is by the adjunction the condition that maps from x to y are in isomorphism with maps from Fx to Fy via applying F, which is what it is for F to be fully faithful).</p>
<p>So how do we see that F is fully faithful?</p>
<p>First of all, note that for any x : X, there is the particular theory Set with internal x : X. Call this theory Kx. Though K may not be a functor as such, we know that GKx = x for any object x. Thus, G is essentially surjective on objects.</p>
<p>From G to GFG by unit, then back to G by counit, is identity, by the zig-zag law for an adjunction. Thus, the unit is at least a split monomorphism at each object in the range of G. But every object is in the range of G by the previous paragraph, so the unit is a split monomorphism at every object.</p>
<p>If we can now show that the monad is idempotent, we are done, by https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/idempotent+monad#Properties.</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<hr />
<p>This goes off the rails with scratch notes now:</p>
<p>GFGK to GK back up to GFGK.</p>
<p>GFx to x back up to GFx.</p>
<p>From GFx, we map to x, because the free theory introduces whatever crap, but all that crap maps into the Set model, which is me. And then from me I map back up into the free theory.</p>
<p>Anyone with a value in it gets a shadow value. In Set, we have the particular rule that shadow values collapse.</p>
<p>Free theory where all sets have a designated involution.</p>
<p>In Set, the designated involution is always identity.</p>
<p>GFx to GKx should be identity?</p>
<p>G(Fx to Kx)</p>
<p>Ok, suppose we have theories T, and a functor from Ts to Cat taking each T to its category of internal Xes. An X internal to T is any map into T from some designated free T on the initial X, call this R.</p>
<p>And there's a particular theory T called Set, and the claim is that we have an adjunction between T-with-an-internal-X</p>
<p>So maps from R to t induce maps from R to Set.</p>
<p>unit at Kx, taken through adjunction, then G applied.</p>
<p>Kx to GFKx</p>
<p>x -&gt; GKx
FGKx -&gt; Kx is such that G applied to me is a monic.
GFx -&gt; GKx</p>
<p>G(counit)K is monic</p>
<p>Fx = FGKx</p>
<p>G x to GFG x</p>
<p>Gx = GFy.</p>
<p>Maybe something about sconing will help here.</p>
<p>Given a T with internal X, we (X, T, function from X to G(T))</p>
<p>An X internal to T is a T-indexed X. A functor from T to (Theory of X) lexly to Set. A lex functor from Theory of X to Set^T. The free lex theory with an internal T</p>
<hr />
<p>The salient thing is actually how Hom(1, -) produces free models of lex theories.</p>
