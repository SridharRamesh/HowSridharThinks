    <p>Suppose you prove B from A and later also prove A from B. Useless, right?</p>
<p>Well, no. You’ve proven a wonderful fact. You’ve proven that A and B are equivalent. Each follows, by whatever story you gave, from the other.</p>
<p>What you haven’t accomplished is to reach this entailment back to grounding; to show that A is furthermore a tautology. But this is ok. Not everything in math is about reaching back to the ground in this way. This is not the only way in which to be useful.</p>
<p>Mathematicians are in the business of understanding things. To understand that some A and B both readily entail each other is very frequently clarifying. Depending on the context, this may be a greater boost to understanding than the task of showing one or the other to be entailed from first principles.</p>
<p>Of course, one has to understand what one is doing. If you are a student assigned to prove A from some framework, and you prove A from B and B from A, however hypothetically useful this may be for advancing your understanding of A and B as two guises of the same underlying concept, however much I celebrate the theoretical value of such things, you likely will receive neither an A nor a B on the assignment.</p>
<p>[TODO: Speak also of Wittgenstein’s views on mathematicians’ paranoia about “the hidden contradiction”; speak of the value of inconsistent systems despite ex falso quodlibet]</p>
