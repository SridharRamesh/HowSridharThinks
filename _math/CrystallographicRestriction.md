Under what circumstances can a regular n-gon be made such that all its points are lattice points, for some lattice?

Here, I do not mean to restrict only to square lattices, but to any discrete (i.e., points cannot be found arbitrarily close to each other) subset of the plane closed under integer weight affine combinations. [That is, a torsor for some subgroup of the vectors of the plane]

These things are sometimes called crystallographic.

In general, the symmetry group of a regular n-gon will be noncrystallographic just in case the n-th cyclotomic polynomial has degree > 2, which will happen for n other than 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.

The proof is like so: Take a regular n-gon within a lattice.

Its central point may not be a lattice point, but if we pick an arbitrary lattice point, we can scale everything up by a factor of n in terms of its displacement from this point, yielding a new regular n-gon whose center is a lattice point.

This n-gon's vertices can be considered as lattice vectors relative to its center. Relative to any one of these vectors, the other vectors are given by rotations corresponding to the complex numbers which are n-th roots of unity.

Since all of these vectors are lattice vectors, so are arbitrary integer linear combinations of them. Thus, the entire ring of integer linear combinations of n-th roots of unity must form a lattice.

So now the matter reduces to checking conditions under which this occurs. This amounts to checking conditions under which this ring is "2-dimensional" over the integers, which amounts to looking at the degree of the n-th cyclotomic polynomial.

(TODO: I save the details for later, when there's a point to my writing this.)

The key lemma to see is that every discrete subgroup of 2d real vector space is isomorphic to the additive group Z^n for some n <= 2 (whichever n characterizes the dimension of its convex, i.e. real, closure). Aka, every non-empty lattice has a "fundamental pair of periods". However, the ring generated by n-th roots of unity is isomorphic to Z^(ϕ(n)), with ϕ(n) as the degree of the n-th cyclotomic polynomial.
