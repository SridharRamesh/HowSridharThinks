Under what circumstances can a regular n-gon be made such that all its points are lattice points, for some lattice?

Here, I do not mean to restrict only to square lattices, but to any discrete (i.e., points cannot be found arbitrarily close to each other) subset of the plane closed under integer weight affine combinations. \[That is, a discrete torsor for some subgroup of the vectors of the plane.\]

These things are sometimes called crystallographic.

In general, the symmetry group of a regular n-gon will be crystallographic just in case the n-th cyclotomic polynomial has degree ≤ 2, which will happen precisely for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.

The proof is like so: 

The lattice in question can be thought of as the subring of the complex numbers generated by any primitive nth root of unity. From this point of view, the question of discreteness is the question as to whether this subset of the complex numbers contains arbitrarily small nonzero values. This is equivalently the question of whether this contains any nonzero value of size < 1, as such a value can be multiplied by itself repeatedly to become arbitrarily small but nonzero.

If n ≤ 2, our subring contains no non-real values. For n > 2, if our subring contains arbitrarily small purely imaginary values, they can be rotated into arbitrarily small nonzero values which are not purely imaginary. And if our subring contains arbitrarily small nonzero values which are not purely imaginary, then by adding them to their complex conjugate, it contains arbitrarily small nonzero real values.

So the question is really as to the discreteness of the real components here; that is, the discreteness of the additive group generated by doubling cosines of multiples of 360°/n.

Again, it suffices to consider whether or not any of these doubled cosines are smaller in magnitude than 1 without being zero; that is, whether or not any of these cosines lie strictly between 1/2 and -1/2 without being 0; that is, whether any of these angles lie between 60° and 120° without being 90°. It is readily seen this happens when n = 5 and when n > 6, but not otherwise.

Alternatively, we can argue like so: if all these cosines are rational, then this group is discrete. Otherwise, it is not (by taking suitable linear combinations of an irrational cosine and cos(0) = 1). As cos(mx) is an integer polynomial of cos(x) for any integer m, it suffices to know whether cos(360°/n) is rational.

This is equivalently the question of whether 2 cos(360°/n) is rational, and as 2 cos(360°/n) = r + r^(-1) for the rotation r by 360°/n, we see that it is an algebraic integer (that is, the root of a monic polynomial; r is an algebraic integer, since r^n - 1 = 0, and so is r^(-1) in the same way, and any sum or product of algebraic integers is an algebraic integer). Thus, 2 cos(360°/n) can only be rational if it is actually an integer. Since cosine ranges from -1 to 1, we can conclude that this is only rational when cos(360°/n) = 0, $\pm 1$, or $\pm 1/2$. This happens precisely at n = 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.

Argued yet another way, for n > 2, the algebraic degree of 2 cos(360°/n) (in the sense of the degree of the corresponding field extension of the rationals) must be half the degree of r, by considering how roots bundle with their complex conjugate. This is $\phi(n)$, and thus we obtain rationality/discreteness just when $\phi(n) = 2$, where $\phi$ is the totient function. Again, this happens precisely at $n = 3, 4, or 6$ (plus the $n = 1$ and $n = 2$ cases which correspond to $\phi(n) = 1$).

Finally, putting everything yet another way, we can rule out n > 6 by noting that in these cases, |r - 1| < 1 (as |r - 1| = 2 sin(180°/n) < 2 sin(30°) = 1). And we can rule out n = 5 by noting that in this case, $|r + r^(-1)| < 1$ (as $|r + r^(-1)|$ = 2 cos(360°/n) = 2 cos(72°) < 2 cos(60°) = 1).

This completes the proof. We obtain not just crystallographic restriction but also by the samea rgument that the only rational cosines and sines of rational angles (in the sense of rational multiples of full revolutions) are at 0, $\pm 1$, or $\pm 1/2$.

A similar argument also shows that the only rational tangents or cotangents of rational angles are 0 or $\pm 1$. We could conclude this fact about rational (co)tangents also by considering the properties of the Gaussian integers as a unique factorization domain.

Old proof that I left unfinished but that there must be something to:

Take a regular n-gon within a lattice.

Its central point may not be a lattice point, but if we pick an arbitrary lattice point, we can scale everything up by a factor of n in terms of its displacement from this point, yielding a new regular n-gon whose center is a lattice point.

This n-gon's vertices can be considered as lattice vectors relative to its center. Relative to any one of these vectors, the other vectors are given by rotations corresponding to the complex numbers which are n-th roots of unity.

Since all of these vectors are lattice vectors, so are arbitrary integer linear combinations of them. Thus, the entire ring of integer linear combinations of n-th roots of unity must form a lattice.

So now the matter reduces to checking conditions under which this occurs. This amounts to checking conditions under which this ring is "2-dimensional" over the integers, which amounts to looking at the degree of the n-th cyclotomic polynomial.

(TODO: I save the details for later, when there's a point to my writing this.)

The key lemma to see is that every discrete subgroup of 2d real vector space is isomorphic to the additive group Z^n for some n <= 2 (whichever n characterizes the dimension of its convex, i.e. real, closure). Aka, every non-empty lattice has a "fundamental pair of periods". However, the ring generated by n-th roots of unity is isomorphic to Z^(ϕ(n)), with ϕ(n) as the degree of the n-th cyclotomic polynomial.
