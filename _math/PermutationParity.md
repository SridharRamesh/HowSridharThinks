I am fond of saying that the two theorems that laypeople do not know because curricula arbitrarily do not bother to show them, yet which are about phenomena of ubiquitous generality in down-to-Earth grade school mathematics, are Bezout's theorem and the fact that permutations carry parity. I know of two traditional proofs for this fact, but perhaps they are the same in the end. Let's see.

First, consider a simple graph on N nodes; that is, an undirected graph without bothering to allow reflexive or multiple edges. We can take this as specifying a set of transpositions on the set of nodes; each edge says we are given the transposition which exchanges the two nodes it connects and acts as identity elsewhere.

The graph is split into connected components, and the transpositions it corresponds to generate all and only those permutations which leave each node within the same connected component it started in.

Proof: That each node is left within the same connected component it started in is obvious, as no transposition moves anyone out of their connected component. That all transpositions within a connected component can be generated follows once we establish transitivity: if you can generate the transposition (a b) and the transposition (b c), then you can generate the transposition (a c), as the composition (a b) (b c) (a b).

From now on, let's presume our graph has a single connected component.

We furthermore get from it a simple graph on the symmetric group on N nodes, where two elements are connected by an edge just in case some edge in the original graph gives a transposition which takes them to each other. [Note that this is a much larger graph than the one we started with; it has N! nodes]. We can also look just as well at torsors of the symmetric group, which is sometimes more convenient, but I'll phrase things this way for now.

Often, it'll be the case that we can define a function f from the nodes of this large graph to natural numbers such that:
A) Identity is the unique value taken to 0 by f.
B) Any value which is not the identity is such that it has a neighbor on which the value of f is one less.
C) Neighbors always have values of f which differ by no more than 1.
D) Neighbors always have values of f which differ by no less than 1.

A, B, and C ensure that f is the distance from identity function. Adding in D tells us that furthermore this is a bipartite graph; thus we get our notion of parity for permutations.

Note that we get the same notion of parity no matter what graph we start with, noting that our composition law above for paths in a transposition graph preserves oddity and thus makes all transpositions odd. [More specifically, a path of length n of basic transpositions can be turned into a composition of 2n - 1 basic transpositions]

One case of interest is when the graph we start with is the complete graph on N nodes. This is the proof of permutation parity by cycle counting. (This gives another way to see that no matter what choice of initial graph we make, we get the same parity concept in the end, since any path of even or odd length in some subgraph is subsumed as a path of the same length in this one.)

Another case of interest is when the graph we start with is an N node linear path. This is the proof of permutation parity by inversion counting.

Are other cases such that we can make f in a convenient way as well? E.g., the graph on 4 nodes with one hub and three spokes? We can always make the f which satisfies the desired properties, but can we actually see that it satisfies the desired properties beforehand, without already knowing the parity theorem? Can we read the distance off quickly in some fashion?

TODO!

[TODO: Rewrite everything for readability. Expand on cycle counting and inversion counting proofs in detail.]

[TODO: We needn't only talk about distances in terms of transpositions. We could take odd involutions or odd permutations more generally in our basis]

[TODO: This all relates to a more general phenomenon about distance functions in Coxeter groups. The linear graph representation is directly a Coxeter group. The complete graph representation isn't directly a Coxeter group, it's just a group generated by involutions but also containing further relations than the Coxeter ones, but perhaps there's something to say there in Coxeter style too?]
