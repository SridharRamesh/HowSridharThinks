Consider using Haskell library `reanimate` (inspired by 3blue1brown's `manim`) to make videos of some of these.

The `physics` package for MathJax seems to have some bugs around spacing or bracket sizing in nested scenarios which the ordinary LaTeX `physics` package does not. Consider $$\qty(3 + \log(\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}}))$$ and $$\qty(3 + \logarithm(\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}}))$$. A lot of people complain about the ordinary LaTeX `physics` package as well, alas, but this doesn't seem to be actually due to that.

I seem to have once considered Franklin (see https://franklinjl.org/). But for now I'm using Zola. No one seems to talk about Franklin at all anymore. Perhaps they never really much did.
