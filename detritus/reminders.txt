The most annoying thing about Zola currently is that it does not seem to support relative internal links. It allows @blahblah/foo/bar.md style links, but these always start from the content directory. So one cannot easily move around the directory structure. I will live with this for now.

Similarly, the Pickles theme I am currently using seems to require posts in the root of the content directory. That's not actually a problem, but I also think conceptually, I may prefer to just recreate this theme myself instead of locking into their choices.

----

The themes are added as git submodules (e.g., Pickles currently). When I eventually get rid of any of them, I may wish to know how to fully remove a git submodule. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1260748/how-do-i-remove-a-submodule

The Pickles page summaries can cut of in the middle of a LaTeX block, and the result will then be displayed with two dollar signs and no closing two dollar signs, thus not parsed as LaTeX by MathJax. This perhaps should be manually addressed in each instance using <!-- more --> to indicate the end of the summary section.

The auto-generated Pickles page summaries also strip HTML tags; thus, e.g., links do not appear as links in them. But if the summary has explicitly been created using <!-- more --> indicator, this will not happen.

Consider using Haskell library `reanimate` (inspired by 3blue1brown's `manim`) to make videos of some of these.

The `physics` package for MathJax seems to have some bugs around spacing or bracket sizing in nested scenarios which the ordinary LaTeX `physics` package does not. Consider $$\qty(3 + \log(\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}}))$$ and $$\qty(3 + \logarithm(\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}}))$$. A lot of people complain about the ordinary LaTeX `physics` package as well, alas, but this doesn't seem to be actually due to that.

I seem to have once considered Franklin (see https://franklinjl.org/). But for now I'm using Zola. No one seems to talk about Franklin at all anymore. Perhaps they never really much did.

Note that \; which is sometimes used in LaTeX for spacing is treated as an escape sequence for ; simpliciter in CommonMark (see https://spec.commonmark.org/0.13/#backslash-escapes). Thus, we must use \\; in its place.
