Magic names used by Zola:

Always used or replaced with default:
404.html (Displayed on 404 errors, in templates).
robots.txt (Used to generate robots.txt, in templates)
summary-cutoff.text (Used to generate ellipses or other suffixes or lack thereof at the end of page summaries explicitly demarcated by <!-- more -->, in templates)
More are found at https://github.com/getzola/zola/blob/master/components/templates/src/lib.rs

Can be overridden:
index.html (The homepage, in templates. But overridden if there is an _index.md in the root of content which specifies a different section template. Presumably also overridden if there is an index.md in the root of content.)
page.html (Default page template, in templates)
section.html (Default section template, in templates)

Special function:
_index.md (Creates sections, in folders under content)
index.md (Generates a page with the name of its directory; in general, [name].md is equivalent to name/about.md, as long as name is neither "_index" nor "index". Note that page names cannot contain "_index" anywhere within them.)
