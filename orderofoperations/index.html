    <p>Laypeople seem to spend an inordinate amount of mental energy on something called "Order of Operations" that they imagine to be deeply important and fundamental in mathematics.</p>
<p>It's not their fault. This is how their teachers present it to them. This is what they are trained to think comprises the nature of math and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, anyone reading this blog knows that reality is not so.</p>
<p>There are only three genuine "order of operations" notation rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Subtractions in a string of additions and subtractions are parsed with minimal subtrahend scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiplication binds more tightly than addition or subtraction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Base of exponentiation binds more tightly than any of those.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything else is something that either provides explicit impossible to misparse scope (bracketed expressions, superscripted exponentiation, fractions written vertically with numerator and denominator separated by a vinculum) or which cannot be relied on as a mechanical rule to clarify ambiguity in the empirical practice of how mathematicians read and write.</p>
<p>All of this only exists because we insist on sticking with infix notation in the first place (frankly, even prefix notation is but a hack for writing out the nonlinear expression trees that directly capture what we mean; we should just write out the trees!). A purely syntactic matter, having nothing to do with the actual mathematical concepts of arithmetic, algebra, etc. Just notational conventions, for the translation of what one means into symbols and back.</p>
