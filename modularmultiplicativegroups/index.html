    <p>By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the ring of integers modulo N is the product of the rings of integers modulo p^n, for each prime power p^n in the factorization of N. To study the integers modulo p^n, it is helpful to consider the p-adics.</p>
<p>By Fermat's little theorem and Hensel's lemma, there is for every possible last digit in the p-adic integers, a unique value x with that last digit satisfying x^p = x. If that last digit is 0, then x = 0 of course. The rest of these form a cyclic group of order p - 1 [by the cyclicity of the multiplicative group of a finite field; see https://howsridharthinks.wordpress.com/2019/12/02/field-multiplication-cyclicity/ ].</p>
<p>Every invertible (i.e., indivisible by p) p-adic integer can uniquely be written as one of these (p - 1)-th roots of unity times a p-adic integer whose last digit is 1.</p>
<p>So what is left is to determine the structure of the multiplicative group of p-adic integers whose last digit is 1.</p>
<p>Note that (1 + p^j x)^p = 1 + p^{j + 1}x + (p choose 2)p^{2j} x^2 + a bunch of terms which include at least a p^{3j} factor.</p>
<p>If j \geq 1, then all the elided terms have more factors of p than p^{j + 1}x. If p is odd or j &gt; 1, the same is true of the (p choose 2)p^{2j} x^2 term. Thus, we find that in these cases, the number of 0 digits in a row after the initial (least significant) 1 digit goes up by precisely 1 when we take p-th powers. This establishes that in these cases, the multiplicative group of n digit values with last digit 1 is cyclic, with generator any value which has no 0 digits after the initial 1 digit (since such a value would have order dividing p^{n - 1} but not dividing p^{n - 2}, and thus precisely p^{n - 1}, the order of the entire group).</p>
<p>The remaining case is where p is 2 and j = 1. But we can handle this by observing that, in the 2-adics, every value ending in 1 either ends in 01 or ends in 11, with negation switching between these two. So we can negate as necessary to ensure an ending value of 01 (i.e., j &gt; 1), and then use the fact from before. This tells us the multiplicative group of n digit values with last digit 01 is cyclic, and the multiplicative group of n digit values with last digit 1 is Z_2 times that subgroup.</p>
<p>These cylicity results state that there is an isomorphism between the multiplicative group of values with last digit 1 and the additive group of values with last digit 0 in the integers modulo p^n for odd p (or between the values with last digit 01 and the values with last digit 00, respectively, for p = 2). This isomorphism amounts to logarithm, with exponential as its inverse; we can in fact construct the natural logarithm and natural exponential by power series as well, paying suitable attention to the radius of convergence to get the same results as above.</p>
<p>This completes the description of the multiplicative group of invertible values in the p-adics and thus in the N-adics (and thus also the structure of the corresponding groups mod N for any finite N). The full multiplicative monoid of p-adics is this previous group times the additive monoid of natural numbers (the multiplicative monoid of powers of p), of course. And the full multiplicative group of p-adic rationals uses "integers" in place of the previous line's "natural numbers".</p>
<p>[TODO: Rewrite stuff on values = 1 mod p in terms of the observation that they come with a valuation under multiplication which has the right properties to match a valuation under addition, and the construction of the logarithm automatically from this]</p>
<p>[TODO: LaTeXify the above]</p>
