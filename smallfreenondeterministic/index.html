    <p>The following generalization of a certain traditional argument occurred to me today, my needing it in some argument, and so I thought I would record it for my own future use if ever I need it again:</p>
<p>Suppose given a (possibly large collection) V, along with a small number of operations from powers of V to itself. Each of these operations has a fixed small arity. Furthermore, these operations may be partial or nondeterministic: That is, instead of outputting a single element of V, they may output a set of elements of V. The cardinality of this set need not be bounded in any a priori fashion, except that it must indeed be a small set and not a proper class.</p>
<p>Then there is a small subset of V which is closed under all of these operations (in the sense that it includes ALL results of applying any of these operations to itself).</p>
<p>Proof: Consider all the well-founded syntax trees describing some way of composing these operations. There are only a small number of shapes such trees can take (we have a suitable W-type describing the set of such trees). For any such tree, we may inductively prove that the possible values taken by any node within that tree comprise a small set (there are a small number of children of this node, each of which may take on a small number of values, and also a small number of choices for the label at this node specifying which operation we are using. Thus, a small number of choices for the tuple altogether of what operation we are applying to what values. For each of these choices, we have a small number of possible outputs. And thus the number of possible values this node may take on is the union of a small set of small sets, thus itself small). Thus, the number of possible values output at the root is the union over a small number of tree shapes of the small number of possibilities at the root of each such tree shape. Thus, itself small, completing the proof.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alternate presentation of this proof: For any small subset S of V, we may consider another small subset S' of V extending S, such that S' is obtained from S by adding every possible application of one of our operations to elements of S. We seek an S which already contains its S'.</p>
<p>Consider the following transfinite recursion over small ordinals: At 0, we take any small subset of V you like. At successor stages, we apply the above operation to go from S to S'. At limit stages, we take the union of previous stages (a small union of small sets). This must stabilize once we reach any limit ordinal of cofinality greater than all our operations' arities. At that point, we have the desired small subset of V.</p>
<hr />
<p>The existence of W-types and the existence of ordinals of suitably high cofinality must be related.</p>
