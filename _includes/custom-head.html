  Placeholder to allow defining custom head, in principle, you can add anything here, e.g. favicons:

  1. Head over to https://realfavicongenerator.net/ to add your own favicons.
  2. Customize default _includes/custom-head.html in your source directory and insert the given code snippet.

  Taken from https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/master/_includes/custom-head.html and modified for MathJAX support using instructions at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50998466/how-to-use-latex-in-new-jekyll-gem-based-theme-minima,
  updated to version 2.7.7.

  Turns out, see https://github.com/jekyll/minima/issues/472, this isn't supported yet. But I've manually modified _layouts/default.html to load 
  it anyway.
