  Taken from https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/master/_includes/custom-head.html and modified for MathJAX support using instructions at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50998466/how-to-use-latex-in-new-jekyll-gem-based-theme-minima,
  updated to MathJax version 2.7.7.

  Turns out, see https://github.com/jekyll/minima/issues/472, this custom-head.html business isn't supported by default yet. But I've manually modified _layouts/default.html to load it anyway.
