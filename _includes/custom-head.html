  Taken from https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/master/_includes/custom-head.html and modified for MathJAX support using instructions at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50998466/how-to-use-latex-in-new-jekyll-gem-based-theme-minima,
  updated to always use the latest MathJax version per instructions at https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted. Note that, according to the documentation at http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/start.html?highlight=polyfill#browser-compatibility, the polyfill line is just for ensuring backwards compatibility with older browsers, while the second line actually loads MathJax.

  Turns out, see https://github.com/jekyll/minima/issues/472, this custom-head.html business isn't supported by default yet. But I've manually modified _layouts/default.html to load it anyway.
