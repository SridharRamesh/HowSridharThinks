    <p>A curious fact about modal logic is that any normal (in the Kripke sense) modal logic containing Löb's theorem ($$\Box (\Box A \Rightarrow A) \vdash \Box A$$) as an axiom also contains 4 ($$\Box A \vdash \Box \Box A$$) as an axiom. <span id="continue-reading"></span></p>
<p>Proof:
$$A \vdash \Box(A \wedge \Box A) \Rightarrow A \wedge \Box A$$, fairly straightforwardly.</p>
<p>Thus,</p>
<p>$$\Box A \vdash \Box( \Box(A \wedge \Box A) \Rightarrow A \wedge \Box A)$$. But this in turn, via Löb's theorem, entails $$\Box(A \wedge \Box A)$$, which of course entails $$\Box \Box A$$.</p>
<p>Thus, $$\Box A \vdash \Box \Box A$$.</p>
<hr />
<p>[In the above, $$\Box$$ and $$\wedge$$ are to be read with tightest possible scope, while $$\Rightarrow$$ is read with loosest possible scope]</p>
<hr />
<p>Note that containing $$\Box (\Box A \Rightarrow A) \vdash \Box A$$ as an axiom is different than containing the inference rule that you can conclude $$ \vdash A$$ from $$\Box A \vdash A$$. The latter (external Löb's theorem) corresponds to having a well-founded accessibility relation. The former (internal Löb's theorem) corresponds to being both well-founded and transitive.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we can derive the external Löb's theorem from the internal Löb's theorem. Like so: Suppose we have internal Löb's theorem in play. Then from $$\Box A \vdash A$$ we derive $$\vdash \Box A \Rightarrow A$$ and thus $$\vdash \Box(\Box A \Rightarrow A)$$. Applying our internal version of Löb's theorem, we get $$\vdash \Box A$$. But now we can combine this with our starting presumption of $$\Box A \vdash A$$, and conclude $$\vdash A$$, as desired.</p>
<p>Conversely, given external Löb's theorem and 4, we can derive internal Löb's theorem, like so: Suppose given $$\Box(\Box (\Box A \Rightarrow A) \Rightarrow \Box A)$$ and $$\Box (\Box A \Rightarrow A)$$ as hypotheses. Using 4 on the latter, we obtain $$\Box \Box (\Box A \Rightarrow A)$$. Combining this with the former, we get $$\Box \Box A$$. Combining this with $$\Box (\Box A \Rightarrow A)$$ again, we get $$\Box A$$. Thus, discharging our hypotheses, we are able to derive $$\Box(\Box (\Box A \Rightarrow A) \Rightarrow \Box A) \vdash  (\Box (\Box A \Rightarrow A)) \Rightarrow \Box A$$. Applying external Löb's theorem to this, we obtain $$\vdash (\Box (\Box A \Rightarrow A)) \Rightarrow \Box A$$, or just as well, $$\Box (\Box A \Rightarrow A) \vdash \Box A$$, which is internal Löb's theorem.</p>
<hr />
<p>It is worth noting that our argument deriving 4 from Löb's theorem doesn't actually depend on $$\Box$$ distributing over conjunctions, and thus holds in even greater generality. For example, it tells us this more general fact: Let $$f$$ be an operator on a meet-semilattice such that, whenever any $$x$$ and $$y$$ are such that $$x \wedge f(y) \leq y$$, then furthermore $$f(x) \leq f(y)$$. Then $$f \leq f^2$$.</p>
<p>Or even more generally: Let $$f$$ and $$g$$ be endofunctors of a meet-semilattice such that whenever $$x \wedge f(y) \leq y$$, then furthermore $$g(x) \leq g(y)$$. Then $$g \leq gf$$. Because we can consider $$y = x \wedge f(x)$$, for which we have $$x \wedge f(y) \leq y$$, to derive $$g(x) \leq g(y) = g(x \wedge f(x)) \leq g(f(x))$$.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-Functoriality-1"><a href="#fn-Functoriality">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Curiously, there is another approach we can take in the context of a complete lattice. The above just depends on the existence of some value t such that $$x \wedge f(t) \leq t \leq f(x)$$. The particular $$t$$ used was $$x \wedge f(x)$$, but any other choice will suffice. Note that, for the endofunctor $$t \mapsto x \wedge f(t)$$, any coalgebra will be $$\leq f(x)$$, so it would also suffice to have any pair of an algebra $$\leq$$ a coalgebra. In particular, it would suffice for this endofunctor to have a fixed point, and the Knaster-Tarski theorem assures us (in complete lattices) that it does. (However, I do not see that this approach could be made to cover general meet-semilattices.)</p>

<p>We can even drop the precondition that $$g$$ is functorial/order-preserving, as this is recoverable anyway from the Löb condition. <a href="#fr-Functoriality-1">↩</a></p>
