Consider a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct non-adjacent vertices have a unique common neighbor, and every pair of adjacent vertices have precisely λ common neighbors. Examples of such graphs are friendship graphs (with λ = 1) and Moore graphs of diameter 2 (with λ = 0).

In such a graph, any two non-adjacent nodes (let us call them A and B) have the same number of neighbors. We see this as follows:

Each of A and B may have three kinds of neighbors: the unique common neighbor between A and B (let us call this N), other neighbors adjacent to N, and other neighbors non-adjacent to N. Each of A and B has precisely 1 neighbor of the first kind and precisely λ neighbors of the second kind. So what remains is to construct a bijection between the neighbors of the third kind. Consider paths from A through two intermediate nodes to B, where neither intermediate node is N. It is immediate that such paths are in bijection with both the relevant neighbors of A and the relevant neighbors of B, by sending such a path to its first or second intermediate node. This completes the proof.

Furthermore, the equivalence relation generated by non-adjacency relates any two "normal" nodes, where a node is considered non-"normal" just in case it is adjacent to all other nodes. To see this, let A and B be two distinct "normal" nodes, with A non-adjacent to distinct A' and B non-adjacent to distinct B'. If A and B are themselves non-adjacent, or A' is non-adjacent to B, or A is non-adjacent to B', then we are done. Otherwise, we have a path from A' to B to A to B', with all four nodes distinct. If A' and B' were themselves adjacent, then A and B would have two common neighbors, which is forbidden. Thus, A is non-adjacent to A' which is non-adjacent to B' which is non-adjacent to B.

Thus, either the graph is strongly regular (all nodes have the same degree), or it has some node adjacent to all others. In the latter case where there is some special node adjacent to all others, the conditions on the remainder of the graph with this special node removed are that any two distinct non-adjacent nodes have no common neighbor, any two adjacent nodes have λ - 1 common neighbors, and any node at all has λ neighbors. The first of these conditions is that the relation "x is adjacent to or equal to y" is transitive (in addition to automatically being symmetric and reflexive), and then the latter conditions are that each equivalence class of this equivalence relation has size λ + 1. In other words, we take the union of a number of complete graphs on λ + 1 nodes each, and then add a node adjacent to all others; in other words, we glue together a number of complete graphs on λ + 2 nodes each, identifying one node from each (when λ = 0, this is a hub and spokes; when λ = 1, this is a windmill graph).
