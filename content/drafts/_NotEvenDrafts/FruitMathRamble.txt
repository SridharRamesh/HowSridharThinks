After a change of variables, a/(b + c) + b/(a + c) + c/(a + b) becomes [via x = b + c, y = a + c, z = a + b]
(x + y)(y + z)(z + x)/(xyz) = 13.

Note that (x + y)(y + z)(z + x)/(xyz) = (x + y + z)(1/x + 1/y + 1/z) - 1. This is manifestly symmetric under permutation or reciprocation of the variables. Call this CR(x, y, z). Note that CR(x, y, z) = CR(kx, ky, kz).

Note that (CR(x, y, z) - k)xyz is a homogenous polynomial in x, y, z, irreducible unless k = 0 or -1. Its roots are the solutions to CR(x, y, z) = k along with the "extraneous" solutions which are (0, 0, 0), all nonzero multiples of the three permutations of (0, 1, -1), and all nonzero multiples of the three permutations of (1, 0, 0).

For any fixed k other than 0, -1, or 8, the values {p | CR(p) = k} (including extraneous solutions as above), interpreted as points in projective space, comprise a nonsingular elliptic curve C(k). When k = 8, we have one singular point at (1, 1, 1).

Note that for each (x, y, z), we have that there is a plane whose three roots are (x, y, z), (y, x, z), and (1, -1, 0); in particular, (1, -1, 0) is a triple point/"flex" [and similarly for its permutations]. Taking this flex as our origin, the point (0, 0, 1) is of order 2; indeed, for each (x, y, z), we have that (x, y, z), (1/y, 1/x, 1/z), and (0, 0, 1) are also the three roots of some plane [that is, (0, 0, 1) - (1, -1, 0) represents in the Pic^0 group the action on the points of the elliptic curve which sends (x, y, z) to (1/x, 1/y, 1/z)].

Let f(x, y) = (x - y)/(x + y). Note that f(1/x, 1/y) = -f(x, y) [this also equals f(y, x)]. Thus, f(x, y)f(x, z) is invariant under reciprocation of its inputs. Thus, defining F(x, y, z) as (f(x, y)f(x, z), f(y, x)f(y, z), f(z, x)f(z, y)), we find that f is invariant under reciprocation of its inputs, as well as F(permutation of (x, y,z)) = same permutation of F(x, y, z).

(Clearing denominators, a scaled up version of F is F'(x, y, z) = ((x - y)(x - z)(y + z), ...), which is perhaps a nicer simpler expression)

This F(x, y, z) has the incredible property that CR(p) * CR(F(p)) = -8 for all input triples p on which this is well-defined.

Our F gives an isogeny [why is it a group homomorphism?] from C(k) to C(-8/k), and thus also in the same way an isogeny from C(-8/k) to C(-8/(-8/k)) = C(k). These are dual isogenies, of degree 2 [thus, their composition is the multiplication by 2 map on the elliptic curve]. The kernel of this map is the order 2 group generated by (0, 0, 1) - (1, -1, 0). [We need some care to understand how this F is defined on (0, 0, 1) and its permutations, sending this to (1, -1, 0) and its permutations, respectively...]

Consider the planes x + y = 0 (the plane whose three roots are (1, -1, 0)) and x + y = k * z (the plane whose roots are (0, 0, 1) with multiplicity 2, along with (1, -1, 0)). We can evaluate for any particular (x, y, z) on our curve C(k) the ratio x + y : x + y - k * z. So long as our point is not one of (0, 0, 1) or (1, -1, 0), this ratio will be an element of the multiplicative group of the rationals. Here we have singled out z as the "special" variable, but we can just as well do this computation relative to any of our three variables. The results using two different choices of "special" variable will agree up to a square factor whenever both defined; that is, we have three partial maps from C(k) to the quotient group Q*/(Q*^2). On points with no zero coordinates, all three maps are defined and agree. On permutations of (0, 1, -1) or (1, 0, 0), two of the maps are defined and agree. Thus we can combine these into one total function from C(k) to Q*/(Q*^2). This map turns out to be a group homomorphism [why? Because a general fact is that pushforward of a principal divisor is a principal divisor, via some reasoning about norms of field extensions...]. The kernel of this map is precisely the range of the isogeny from C(-8/k) to C(k). It turns out that the range of this map is finitely generated as well; indeed, any odd prime which has an odd exponent in a value in the range of this map must furthermore divide (k + 1) [why is that?]. There is a Diophantine equation [given in "Lectures on Elliptic curves" by Cassels or "Rational points on Elliptic Curves" by Silverman] parametrized by one variable, which determines precisely what the range of this map is, based on which values of the parameter make the equation solvable. There is no known method to algorithmically determine solvability of the equation, but often (but not always!) considerations over modular or real arithmetic ("local") along with our previous restriction to finitely generated many candidates (divisors of -2(k + 1)) are enough to solve it.

Note that the Weierstrass form y^2 = x^3 + ax^2 + bx that many use for discussing elliptic curves relates to our C(k) by taking K = k + 1, a = K^2 - 6K - 3, b = 16K. (Or rescaling this; it can easily be reparametrized into c y^2 = x^3 + x^2 + (b/a^2)x for some c).
