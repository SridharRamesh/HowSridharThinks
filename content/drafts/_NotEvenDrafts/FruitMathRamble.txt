After a change of variables, a/(b + c) + b/(a + c) + c/(a + b) = 4 becomes [via x = b + c, y = a + c, z = a + b]
(x + y)(y + z)(z + x)/(xyz) = 13.

Note that (x + y)(y + z)(z + x)/(xyz) = (x + y + z)(1/x + 1/y + 1/z) - 1. This is manifestly symmetric under permutation or reciprocation of the variables. Call this CR(x, y, z). Note that CR(x, y, z) = CR(kx, ky, kz).

Note that (CR(x, y, z) - k)xyz is a homogenous polynomial in x, y, z, irreducible unless k = 0 or -1. Its roots are the solutions to CR(x, y, z) = k along with the "extraneous" solutions which are (0, 0, 0), all nonzero multiples of the three permutations of (0, 1, -1), and all nonzero multiples of the three permutations of (1, 0, 0).

For any fixed k other than 0, -1, or 8, the values {p | CR(p) = k} (including extraneous solutions as above), interpreted as points in projective space, comprise a nonsingular elliptic curve C(k). When k = 8, we have one singular point at (1, 1, 1). (At k = -1, (CR(x, y, z) - k)xyz = 0 factors as (x + y + z)(1/x + 1/y + 1/z)xyz = 0. At k = 0, it factors as (x + y)(x + z)(y + z). At k = infinity, we can think of it as (d CR(x, y, z) - n)xyz = 0 with k = n/d for zero d and nonzero n, thus factoring as xyz = 0.)

(Note that, except at k = 0, the extraneous solutions are the only solutions with two coordinates summing to zero. Note that, except at k = infinity, the extraneous solutions are the only solutions with a coordinate equal to zero.)

Note that for each (x, y, z), we have that there is a plane whose three roots are (x, y, z), (y, x, z), and (1, -1, 0); in particular, (1, -1, 0) is a triple point/"flex" [and similarly for its permutations]. Taking this flex as our origin, the point (0, 0, 1) is of order 2; indeed, for each (x, y, z), we have that (x, y, z), (1/y, 1/x, 1/z), and (0, 0, 1) are also the three roots of some plane [that is, (0, 0, 1) - (1, -1, 0) represents in the Pic^0 group the action on the points of the elliptic curve which sends (x, y, z) to (1/x, 1/y, 1/z)].

Let f(x, y) = (x - y)/(x + y). Note that f(1/x, 1/y) = -f(x, y) [this also equals f(y, x)]. Thus, f(x, y)f(x, z) is invariant under reciprocation of its inputs. Thus, defining F(x, y, z) as (f(x, y)f(x, z), f(y, x)f(y, z), f(z, x)f(z, y)), we find that f is invariant under reciprocation of its inputs, as well as F(permutation of (x, y,z)) = same permutation of F(x, y, z).

(Clearing denominators, a scaled up version of F is F'(x, y, z) = ((x - y)(x - z)(y + z), ...), which is perhaps a nicer simpler expression)

This F(x, y, z) has the incredible property that CR(p) * CR(F(p)) = -8 for all input triples p on which this is well-defined.

(Why is this? Well, we can just work this out using the fact that CR(p) = prod(sums(p))/prod(p), where prod(x, y, z) = xyz and sums(x, y, z) = (y + z, x + z, x + y). Observe that, with cleared denominators, we have that sums(F'(x, y, z)) = (2 (x - y)^2 z, ...). Thus, prod(sums(F'(p))) = 8 prod(p) prod(squaredDiffs(p)), where squaredDiffs(x, y, z) = ((y - z)^2, ...). On the other hand, prod(F'(p)) = -prod(squaredDiffs(p)) prod(sums(p)). But there is probably a better conceptual way to see this...)

Our F gives an isogeny [why is it a group homomorphism? This is because any map between elliptic curves given by polynomials (i.e., a "morphism" of algebraic curves) automatically is a group homomorphism (if it sends 0 to 0). See https://mathoverflow.net/a/12824/3902] from C(k) to C(-8/k), and thus also in the same way an isogeny from C(-8/k) to C(-8/(-8/k)) = C(k). These are dual isogenies, of degree 2 [thus, their composition is the multiplication by 2 map on the elliptic curve]. The kernel of this map is the order 2 group generated by (0, 0, 1) - (1, -1, 0). [We need some care to understand how this F is defined on (0, 0, 1) and its permutations, sending this to (1, -1, 0) and its permutations, respectively...]

Consider the planes x + y = 0 (the plane whose three roots are (1, -1, 0)) and x + y = k * z (the plane whose roots are (0, 0, 1) with multiplicity 2, along with (1, -1, 0)). We can evaluate for any particular (x, y, z) on our curve C(k) the ratio x + y : x + y - k * z. So long as our point is not one of (0, 0, 1) or (1, -1, 0), this ratio will be an element of the multiplicative group of the rationals. Here we have singled out z as the "special" variable, but we can just as well do this computation relative to any of our three variables. The results using two different choices of "special" variable will agree up to a square factor whenever both defined [Why?]; that is, we have three partial maps from C(k) to the quotient group Q*/(Q*^2). On points with no zero coordinates, all three maps are defined and agree. On permutations of (0, 1, -1) or (1, 0, 0), two of the maps are defined and agree. Thus we can combine these into one total function from C(k) to Q*/(Q*^2). This map turns out to be a group homomorphism [why? Because a general fact is that pushforward of a principal divisor is a principal divisor, via some reasoning about norms of field extensions...]. The kernel of this map is precisely the range of the isogeny from C(-8/k) to C(k) [Why?]. It turns out that the range of this map is finitely generated as well; indeed, any odd prime which has an odd exponent in a value in the range of this map must furthermore divide (k + 1) [why is that?]. There is a Diophantine equation [given in "Lectures on Elliptic curves" by Cassels or "Rational points on Elliptic Curves" by Silverman] parametrized by one variable, which determines precisely what the range of this map is, based on which values of the parameter make the equation solvable. There is no known method to algorithmically determine solvability of the equation, but often (but not always!) considerations over modular or real arithmetic ("local") along with our previous restriction to finitely generated many candidates (divisors of -2(k + 1)) are enough to solve it.

Note that the Weierstrass form y^2 = x^3 + ax^2 + bx that many use for discussing elliptic curves relates to our C(k) by taking K = k + 1, a = K^2 - 6K - 3, b = 16K. (Or rescaling this; it can easily be reparametrized into c y^2 = x^3 + x^2 + (b/a^2)x for some c).

---------------

Note that an elliptic curve can be expressed in the form CR(p) = k as above for some k, on some change of basis, just in case the elliptic curve has a triple point (aka, flex) and an element of order six in its group. These conditions are equivalent to having three distinct points A, B, C and three further distinct points a, b, c such that abc, aaa, bbb, ccc, aAA, bBB, cCC, aBC, AbC, ABc are triples. As ABC are not coplanar, we can choose a basis of our 3d space in which (1, 0, 0) represents A, (0, 1, 0) represents B, and (0, 0, 1) represents C. Since a lies on the plane generated by B and C, while not being equivalent to either of them, it has a representation of the form (0, x, y) where neither x nor y are zero. By re-scaling our third basis element according to the ratio -y/x, we can arrange for a to have a representation (0, 1, -1). Similarly, by re-scaling our first basis element, we can arrange for c to have a representation (1, -1, 0). Finally, b must have a representation of the form (x, 0, y) but also lie on the plane containing a and c [which is now the plane where all three coordinates sum to zero]. Thus, b now has a representation (1, 0, -1). 

Since (1, 0, 0) and its permutations are roots of our equation, there are no X^3, Y^3, or Z^3 terms. Since (1, -1, 0) and its permutations are furthermore roots, the X^2Y and XY^2 coefficients match up [and similarly under permutations of the variables]. Finally, since there is a plane on which (1, 0, 0) is a double root and (0, 1, -1) is the other root (the plane where the second and third coordinates sum to zero), we find that the X^2 Y and X^2Z coefficients match up [and similarly under permutations of the variables]. This causes all the coefficients to match up for X^2Y, XY^2, XZ^2, X^2Z, YZ^2, and Y^2Z. Having already eliminated the coefficients for X^3, Y^3, and Z^3, we now have an equation in the desired form.
