By default, Zola will look for three templates: index.html, which is applied to the site homepage; section.html, which is applied to all sections (any HTML page generated by creating a directory within your content directory); and page.html, which is applied to all pages (any HTML page generated by creating an .md file within your content directory).

But I think the index.html in the template directory gets ignored if there is an _index.md at the root of the content directory which specifies a different template?

Note that the _index.md at the root of a section can contain content, but this content is not directly displayed. It is made available to the template, which is what is directly displayed. The template can access this content as the variable `section.content`.

I am choosing to have the homepage be at math-section.html, and thus this index.html is ignored.
