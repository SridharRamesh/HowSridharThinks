[TODO: Equivalence between hom-set definition of adjunctions (including as abstracted to any 2-category) and unit/counit/triangle identities definition. Automatic equivalence also to the “backwards” definition: An adjunction between functors F : C → D (the left adjoint) and G : D → C (the right adjoint) is a bijective correspondence between Hom(xG, y) and Hom(x, yF), natural in x and y. Automatic because the unit/counit/triangle identities definition is symmetric. Note also the concept of an adjunction up to adjunction, aka “quasi-adjunction”, where we don’t get a bijection but only an adjoint correspondence in a higher category. Note how adjunction are like half-inverses, just enough to make the proof of unique inverses still go through.]
