Functional equation for the zeta function (see comment "(1) Titchmarsh points out in his book on the zeta function (section 2.3) that if you blindly apply the Poisson summation formula to the function 𝑓(𝑠)=|𝑥|𝑠, you get the functional equation of the Riemann zeta function immediately, and gives a reference to a paper of Mordell where this procedure is justified." at https://mathoverflow.net/questions/58004/how-does-one-motivate-the-analytic-continuation-of-the-riemann-zeta-function.

Symmetric polynomials, the theorem that any symmetric polynomial of r1, ..., rn is a polynomial in the coefficients of (x + r1)...(x + rn). [Note that, replacing "polynomial" by "rational function" here, this follows directly from Galois theory. Can we get the polynomial version from that in some way, or is there some relation?]

Talk about the Legendre transform from a tropical Fourier-transform perspective (keeping in mind how the ordinary properties fail a little and one must use one sup- Legendre transform followed by one min- Legendre transform, to recover the original function, with this working just in case the original function is convex). Discuss duality in linear programming from this perspective.

Partial derivative notation is awful because it doesn't make clear what's allowed to vary with what, but people lie about how the chain rule in terms of fractions "breaks" in this situation. Re-use the writing already done on MathOverflow/Quora for this situation.

Find the monotonicity/least fixed point probability thing I'd once written about on SDMB.

To think about:

Sum of [2^(-2n) * zeta(2n)]/n from n = 1 to infinity is log(pi/2) [this is an expansion of the Wallis product using the Mercator series at the logarithmic level], but pi itself is closely related to zeta(2), zeta(4), etc. So there's some special fact here.

Sum of [2^(-2n) * zeta(2n)]/(2n) is mean of log(1/2!) and log(-1/2!)? Well, this is just the Wallis product observation.

Generalized factorial

Generalized Riemann zeta?

Generalized power sum formula?

Set up Wallis product recurrence, but have to go over:
Volume is unaffected by shearing
Volume of tapering figures in n-dimensional space (pyramids)
Area relates to surface area on a ball
Finally, surface of any ball is... (alas, this goes over the same ground as a 3b1b video)
Talk about Lambert equal area projection and map projection in general, curvature, etc?
Having gotten the recurrence, we relate to ! and find (1/2)! = sqrt(pi)/2.

Philosophical discussion of how pi comes up in many different contexts.

Do donvolution approach instead as well.

Write up the general theory of Clifford algebras, including the observation that the Clifford algebra can be taken as isomorphic as a vector space to the exterior algebra (non-obvious! See Chevalley's linear identification at http://people.math.harvard.edu/~shlomo/docs/lie_algebras.pdf). Relate this to quaternions, write about spinors. Note the observation that spinors are closed under addition for quaternions because of dimension concerns (two planes in 3d space must intersect in a line).
